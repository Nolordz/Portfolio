        <p>I'm really exited about the idea of joining the programmers world , this past week has been great so far, lots of information and tons of stuff to learn, during the middle of the week I did struggle finding some of the information to resolve one of the home work assignments, but I did not back down until finally came to resolve the  assignment, left me with a pretty good feeling of accomplishment.
Starting a new industry field can be intimidating, but I Know I have made the right choice.
These two weeks we have been working on our personal portfolios, learning the ways of using HTML along with CSS, styling the page was fun.</p>
